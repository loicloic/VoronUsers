# Handles for V0.1 (3mm Panels)

Inspired by [Derpmius' Block Handle](https://github.com/loicloic/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Derpimus/Block_handle_v0.1)

Those handles have been designed to work with [zruncho's No Drop Nuts](https://github.com/loicloic/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/zruncho/V0_No_Drop_Nuts) They work with the existing nut. No need to add new ones.

Need 2x M3x10 BHCS

Print as suggested below, they should be plenty strongs.

Include STEP file for easy modifications.
