# Handles for V0.1 (3mm Panels)

Inspired by [Derpmius' Block Handle](https://github.com/loicloic/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Derpimus/Block_handle_v0.1)

Those handles have been designed to work with [zruncho's No Drop Nuts](https://github.com/loicloic/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/zruncho/V0_No_Drop_Nuts). They will of course also work with a normal nut. They screw into the existing nut, no need to add new ones.

Need 2x M3x10 BHCS

Print as suggested below, they should be plenty strong.

Include STEP file for easy modifications.
